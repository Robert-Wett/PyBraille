# PyBraille
Eventually going to be a clean implementation of [this](https://github.com/Robert-Wett/dailyprogrammer/blob/master/143_Braille.py)

#####Check out a demo on [blockspring](https://api.blockspring.com/users/robert-wett/blocks/319bfef4aad7f3477745048a2da3ae6a) (as of now, the output isn't mono-space, so it doesn't look very good. This should change soon though)

####Example so far...
